## Installation

### Installing the plugin on the server

Copy the folder "TemplateDependenceChecker" into the folder "plugins" of your CMS installation.  
Switch to Server Manager and import the plugin via "Administer Plug-Ins" - "Plug-Ins", action menu "Import Plug-In".  
Assign it to all your desired projects and set the appropriate user rights there if necessary.  
Activate it.

The plugin then appears in the action menu of every content class node within these projects.

###  Code settings

#### TemplateDependenceChecker_dlg.asp

This file contains the dialog box the plugin will start with. Translate the german variables (lines 18-28) if necessary.

####  TemplateDependenceChecker_do.asp

This file contains the plugin script itself. Translate the german variables (lines 21-33) if necessary.

The plugin must be run under an administrator account. Please enter the corresponding login data in lines 18+19.  
This user must have the role "Administrator" and "Template Editor" in all projects, and the number of allowed sessions should be set to at least 2.  
The user also must have access to all language variants in every project. If a language variant is denied for him, it will not occur in the report, and there will be no error message regarding this.

## How to use

In every project the plugin was assigned, it will appear in the action menu of content classes. After clicking OK, the plugin reads the project variant assignment of the selected content 
class in every project that is connected to the corresponding content class folder.

Optionally it also counts the number of active instances of the content class within the master project.

This process can take some minutes.

Finally it will show a report that lists:

- Every connected project
- And for each one of these projects:
  - Which template of the content class is assigned to a project variant
  - Which one is not assigned at all.
  - The number of active instances of the content class

The report looks like the following block. This block repeats for each project:

```
Project: <Name of the connected project>

<Name of the 1st template>: -  
<Name of the 2nd template >: Assigned to <Number> project variants

<Name of language variant 1>: <Number> Instances
<Name of language variant 2>: <Number> Instances
```

(The "-" after the first template means that it is not assigned).

The following error messages can occur:

- "Insufficient user rights to perform the task" (Variable `dlgInsufficientRights`):  
  The user entered in section [TemplateDependenceChecker_do.asp](#templatedependencechecker_doasp) cannot log in.
- "No rights" (Variable `dlgNoRights`):  
  The user entered in section [TemplateDependenceChecker_do.asp](#templatedependencechecker_doasp) is not assigned to the project.
- "Folder not found" (Variable `dlgFolderNotFound`):  
  The project is connected to the content class folder, but it does not use it.
- "Content class not found" (Variable `dlgContentClassNotFound`):  
  The content class cannot be accessed (e.g. due to authorization packets).
